# On-Off-Controller
This technical report aims to provide a detailed guide for constructing a cost-effective DIY mini fridge using a Peltier chip and an on-off control mechanism for temperature regulation. The proposed design utilises readily available components and offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for cooling small spaces or storing perishable items. The temperature regulator fridge is an essential appliance commonly used in households, restaurants, and various other settings to maintain a consistent temperature for food, medicine or skincare products preservation. The on-off controller is a simple yet effective control mechanism that switches the fridge's cooling system on and off based on predefined temperature thresholds.
